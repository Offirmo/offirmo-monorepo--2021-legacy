## Principles

### No mixing of persisted data and logic data

- in general, persisted data should really reflect what is in the persistence layer
- A conversion may be needed from persisted data to actual logic data,
  note the role of thi lib
- Defaults may be provided, however the persisted data shouldn't have them,
  in order to preserve the fact that the data is missing in the first place
