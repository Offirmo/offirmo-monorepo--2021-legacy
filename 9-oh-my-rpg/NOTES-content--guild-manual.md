* safety is the top priority!
* adventurers are ranked F, E, D, C, B, A, S, SS
* you MUST have a secondary profession, you won't be an adventurer forever!
* you must have a knight rank of at least X to be ranked at X
* you are NOT allowed to take quests outside of the guild
* you MUST inform the guild of any threat
* Knights can requisition adventurers of lower ranks
* don't hoard your resources! The guild will buy them and allow you to buy them back later at the same cost!
