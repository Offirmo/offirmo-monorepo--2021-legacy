> The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.

Maria is under pressure to finish a project. She has a strong personality and always puts her work first. She is easily angered when details are missed and struggles to productively handle other people’s mistakes. She is ambitious, eager to be promoted, and values team members who have been around the longest, as they have the most experience. She is wary of new people—not knowing whether she can rely on them makes her very nervous.

Legendary weapons A warrior trains with his weapon so that it becomes an extension of
                  himself, as much a part of his being as his own arm. The more he trains
                  with it, the more intuitively it enhances his fighting style and adds to
                  his prowess. When a warrior survives long enough for his name to become
                  legendary, his weapon of choice becomes legendary also, spoken of in
                  frightened whispers among his enemies. This was certainly true of the
                  legendary weapons encountered in the Lord of the Rings books - Orcrist,
                  Glamdring, Narsil and other such fearsome tools were well-known among
                  the orcs and goblins, hated perhaps even more than the warriors who
                  wielded them. This is also true in the
                  Lord of the Rings Online, where the Legendary Item
                  system allows players to forge their own legacies in steel.

QWESTS
There are usually 4 common goals for a film’s story. Will your story be about:
- Winning?
- Escaping?
- Stopping something or someone?
- Retrieving something of value?

We were taught the 3 act structure mirroring the Hero’s Journey popularised by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces, where the:
- 1st Act sets context of the status quo, with an inciting incident that causes the world to change and a call to adventure for the hero.
- 2nd Act has escalating challenges in the main plot that the hero faces, and the introduction of a secondary plot (e.g. a love story strengthening the main plot) coming full circle in the 3rd Act.
- 3rd Act results in a resolution, climax or twist that the hero experiences to the point of no return, which results in a new status quo in the world.

Dan Harmon (creator of Rick and Morty and Community) has since simplified the theory into 8 steps:
- Establish a protagonist (You) - A character is in a zone of comfort.
- Something ain’t quite right (Need) - We learn that things aren’t perfect in our hero’s universe, setting the stage for external conflict.
- Crossing the Threshold (Go) - They enter an unfamiliar situation, and begin their journey.
- The Road of Trials (Search) - They adapt to their unfamiliar situation. They gain the skills they’ll need to achieve their goals and return home.
- Meeting with the Goddess (Find) - They get what they wanted. The Need (number 2) is fulfilled.
- Pay the Price (Take) - They pay a price for achieving their goal, but a secondary goal is achieved.
- Bringing it Home (Return) - They cross the return threshold, and come back to where they started.
- Master of both Worlds (Change) - The protagonist is in control of their situation, having changed.

A good story always contains conflicts, of which it can be broken down into:
- External: escalating challenges in the short-term as the world changes - or tactics.
- Internal: decisions with significant impacts on long-term success - or strategy.

Beats
We analysed the script and were asked to identify the parts where we thought were important. This is usually something where there is a change from the status quo - it could be a new character introduced, the meeting of hearts, a power dynamic change between characters or a climax/twist. We call this a beat. A short film like this (~10 minutes) will probably have a maximum of 5-6 beats, so we started with around 10+ beats and culled it to 6 core ones.
Of all the different beats, there will be the heart of the film in one of the beats. If we had to only show one scene, this will be the beat that we will show.

Attitudes:
Appetite for leadership
Appetite for collaboration
Patience for problem-solving
Patience with detail
Comfort with risk
Level of drive
