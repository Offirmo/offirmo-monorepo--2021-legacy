> The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.

Maria is under pressure to finish a project. She has a strong personality and always puts her work first. She is easily angered when details are missed and struggles to productively handle other people’s mistakes. She is ambitious, eager to be promoted, and values team members who have been around the longest, as they have the most experience. She is wary of new people—not knowing whether she can rely on them makes her very nervous.

Legendary weapons A warrior trains with his weapon so that it becomes an extension of
                  himself, as much a part of his being as his own arm. The more he trains
                  with it, the more intuitively it enhances his fighting style and adds to
                  his prowess. When a warrior survives long enough for his name to become
                  legendary, his weapon of choice becomes legendary also, spoken of in
                  frightened whispers among his enemies. This was certainly true of the
                  legendary weapons encountered in the Lord of the Rings books - Orcrist,
                  Glamdring, Narsil and other such fearsome tools were well-known among
                  the orcs and goblins, hated perhaps even more than the warriors who
                  wielded them. This is also true in the
                  Lord of the Rings Online, where the Legendary Item
                  system allows players to forge their own legacies in steel.

    Killing non-trivial mobs (the mobs can’t be grey to you).
    Level 51+ quest rewards. Repeatable daily quests in Moria, Lothlorien, Mirkwood and Enedwaith are an excellent source of IXP.
    IXP Runes. These are items that drop from mobs and chests, are rewarded for completing quests and deeds or a by-product of deconstructing a legendary item.
Reforging a Legendary Item
Every ten levels, your legendary item must be reforged before it will earn more IXP.
