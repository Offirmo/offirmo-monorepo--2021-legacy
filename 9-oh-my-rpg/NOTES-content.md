> The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.

Maria is under pressure to finish a project. She has a strong personality and always puts her work first. She is easily angered when details are missed and struggles to productively handle other people’s mistakes. She is ambitious, eager to be promoted, and values team members who have been around the longest, as they have the most experience. She is wary of new people—not knowing whether she can rely on them makes her very nervous.

Legendary weapons A warrior trains with his weapon so that it becomes an extension of
                  himself, as much a part of his being as his own arm. The more he trains
                  with it, the more intuitively it enhances his fighting style and adds to
                  his prowess. When a warrior survives long enough for his name to become
                  legendary, his weapon of choice becomes legendary also, spoken of in
                  frightened whispers among his enemies. This was certainly true of the
                  legendary weapons encountered in the Lord of the Rings books - Orcrist,
                  Glamdring, Narsil and other such fearsome tools were well-known among
                  the orcs and goblins, hated perhaps even more than the warriors who
                  wielded them. This is also true in the
                  Lord of the Rings Online, where the Legendary Item
                  system allows players to forge their own legacies in steel.

QWESTS
There are usually 4 common goals for a film’s story. Will your story be about:
- Winning?
- Escaping?
- Stopping something or someone?
- Retrieving something of value?

We were taught the 3 act structure mirroring the Hero’s Journey popularised by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces, where the:
- 1st Act sets context of the status quo, with an inciting incident that causes the world to change and a call to adventure for the hero.
- 2nd Act has escalating challenges in the main plot that the hero faces, and the introduction of a secondary plot (e.g. a love story strengthening the main plot) coming full circle in the 3rd Act.
- 3rd Act results in a resolution, climax or twist that the hero experiences to the point of no return, which results in a new status quo in the world.

Dan Harmon (creator of Rick and Morty and Community) has since simplified the theory into 8 steps:
- Establish a protagonist (You) - A character is in a zone of comfort.
- Something ain’t quite right (Need) - We learn that things aren’t perfect in our hero’s universe, setting the stage for external conflict.
- Crossing the Threshold (Go) - They enter an unfamiliar situation, and begin their journey.
- The Road of Trials (Search) - They adapt to their unfamiliar situation. They gain the skills they’ll need to achieve their goals and return home.
- Meeting with the Goddess (Find) - They get what they wanted. The Need (number 2) is fulfilled.
- Pay the Price (Take) - They pay a price for achieving their goal, but a secondary goal is achieved.
- Bringing it Home (Return) - They cross the return threshold, and come back to where they started.
- Master of both Worlds (Change) - The protagonist is in control of their situation, having changed.

A good story always contains conflicts, of which it can be broken down into:
- External: escalating challenges in the short-term as the world changes - or tactics.
- Internal: decisions with significant impacts on long-term success - or strategy.

Beats
We analysed the script and were asked to identify the parts where we thought were important.
This is usually something where there is a change from the status quo - it could be a new character introduced, the meeting of hearts, a power dynamic change between characters or a climax/twist.
We call this a beat. A short film like this (~10 minutes) will probably have a maximum of 5-6 beats, so we started with around 10+ beats and culled it to 6 core ones.
Of all the different beats, there will be the heart of the film in one of the beats. If we had to only show one scene, this will be the beat that we will show.

Attitudes:
* Appetite for leadership
* Appetite for collaboration
* Patience for problem-solving
* Patience with detail
* Comfort with risk
* Level of drive

Books https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1269827402856665088
On books, the non-fiction kind:
2. Almost nothing in the world can match the ROI of a great book.
3/
There is no such thing as a cheap book.
4/
Don’t turn book reading into a status game.
5/
Books don’t come with a user manual for a reason. You can use them however you like. There are no rules that 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 be followed.
6/
Books need not be finished. Develop the skill of not finishing okay books and bad books.
7/
A secret for super-learning: Buy many books, start most of them, but finish just a small fraction of them.
8/
Books need not be read sequentially.
9/
Most people 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥  books.

But books have two purposes: they are meant to be 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥 AND they are meant to be 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘥.
10/
A good book should be 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥  once, but 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘥  multiple times.
11/
When reading a book the first time, you’re doing two distinct jobs: learning from it 𝘢𝘯𝘥  making it more user-friendly for the future-you.
12/
Shed the habit of keeping books in pristine condition. Best way to appreciate a good book is to make it look thoroughly tainted by the time you’re done reading it. With underlines, sidenotes, and dogears.
14/
You can use a good book (that you’ve already read) in multiple ways:

Got 5 minutes? Skim through underlines on all the pages you’ve dogeared (the best stuff)

15 min? Skim through all underlines

60 min? Carefully read all the underlines & remind yourself why they resonated
15/
The types of books you choose to read reveal your true priorities better than your stated priorities.
16/
Book consumption is less about time availability & more about the physical setting.

In some settings, it's impossible to read a book e.g., driving, walking. Might as well listen in such settings.

Good policy: listen to a lot of books, buy & read the best ones (multiple times).

Great post! A hack I find useful is trying to recall main concepts from previous chapters  before I continue reading/listening. Exposes gaps in understanding and helps to retain info.
