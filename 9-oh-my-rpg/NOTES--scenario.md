### Play type
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types

- ♦ Achievers
  - prefer to gain "points", levels, equipment and other concrete measurements of succeeding in a game
  - will go to great lengths to achieve rewards that are merely cosmetic
  - want opportunity to show off their skill and hold elite status to others
- ♠ Explorers
  - prefer discovering areas, and immerse themselves in the game world
  - often annoyed by time-restricted missions as that does not allow them to traverse at their own pace
  - enjoy finding glitches or a hidden easter egg
  - enrich themselves in any back story or lore they can find about the people and places in-game
- ♥ Socializers
  - play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself
  - gain the most enjoyment from a game by interacting with other players, and sometimes, computer-controlled characters with personality = offer significant relationships
  - The game is merely a tool they use to meet others in-game or outside of it
  - play some of the more popular games so that they can use the multi-player features
  - some single-player games have a strong community around them. Examples of single-player games where players use the forums to post pictures of what they've created and share experiences
- ♣ Killers
  - thrive on competition with other players, and prefer fighting them to scripted computer-controlled opponents
  - joy of pitting one's skills against an actual player-controlled opponent
  - for most, the joy results from a friendly competitive spirit
  - for others, it's more about power and the ability to hurt others or the thrill of the hunt
