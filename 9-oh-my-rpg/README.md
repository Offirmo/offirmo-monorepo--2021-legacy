## Intro

My RPG framework, comprised of:
* composable building blocks
* final RPG implementations (using the blocks)

Code is isomorphic, targeting node & browser. This is achieved by being text based with progressive augmentations:
1. pure text
1. text with emojis
1. text with styles: ASCII or CSS
1. pictures (displayable in browser or iterm2)
1. ...

Under the hood, it's a [bolt](https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt) monorepo / collection of packages.
Those modules are either in TypeScript or JavaScript, whatever makes the most sense in each case.


## Usage
Compose and profit !
