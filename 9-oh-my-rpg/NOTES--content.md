> The story takes place in a distant land but copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes standing against the encroaching darkness.

Maria is under pressure to finish a project. She has a strong personality and always puts her work first. She is easily angered when details are missed and struggles to productively handle other people’s mistakes. She is ambitious, eager to be promoted, and values team members who have been around the longest, as they have the most experience. She is wary of new people—not knowing whether she can rely on them makes her very nervous.

Legendary weapons A warrior trains with his weapon so that it becomes an extension of
                  himself, as much a part of his being as his own arm. The more he trains
                  with it, the more intuitively it enhances his fighting style and adds to
                  his prowess. When a warrior survives long enough for his name to become
                  legendary, his weapon of choice becomes legendary also, spoken of in
                  frightened whispers among his enemies. This was certainly true of the
                  legendary weapons encountered in the Lord of the Rings books - Orcrist,
                  Glamdring, Narsil and other such fearsome tools were well-known among
                  the orcs and goblins, hated perhaps even more than the warriors who
                  wielded them. This is also true in the
                  Lord of the Rings Online, where the Legendary Item
                  system allows players to forge their own legacies in steel.

QWESTS
There are usually 4 common goals for a film’s story. Will your story be about:
- Winning?
- Escaping?
- Stopping something or someone?
- Retrieving something of value?

We were taught the 3 act structure mirroring the Hero’s Journey popularised by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces, where the:
- 1st Act sets context of the status quo, with an inciting incident that causes the world to change and a call to adventure for the hero.
- 2nd Act has escalating challenges in the main plot that the hero faces, and the introduction of a secondary plot (e.g. a love story strengthening the main plot) coming full circle in the 3rd Act.
- 3rd Act results in a resolution, climax or twist that the hero experiences to the point of no return, which results in a new status quo in the world.

Dan Harmon (creator of Rick and Morty and Community) has since simplified the theory into 8 steps:
- Establish a protagonist (You) - A character is in a zone of comfort.
- Something ain’t quite right (Need) - We learn that things aren’t perfect in our hero’s universe, setting the stage for external conflict.
- Crossing the Threshold (Go) - They enter an unfamiliar situation, and begin their journey.
- The Road of Trials (Search) - They adapt to their unfamiliar situation. They gain the skills they’ll need to achieve their goals and return home.
- Meeting with the Goddess (Find) - They get what they wanted. The Need (number 2) is fulfilled.
- Pay the Price (Take) - They pay a price for achieving their goal, but a secondary goal is achieved.
- Bringing it Home (Return) - They cross the return threshold, and come back to where they started.
- Master of both Worlds (Change) - The protagonist is in control of their situation, having changed.

A good story always contains conflicts, of which it can be broken down into:
- External: escalating challenges in the short-term as the world changes - or tactics.
- Internal: decisions with significant impacts on long-term success - or strategy.

Beats
We analysed the script and were asked to identify the parts where we thought were important.
This is usually something where there is a change from the status quo - it could be a new character introduced, the meeting of hearts, a power dynamic change between characters or a climax/twist.
We call this a beat. A short film like this (~10 minutes) will probably have a maximum of 5-6 beats, so we started with around 10+ beats and culled it to 6 core ones.
Of all the different beats, there will be the heart of the film in one of the beats. If we had to only show one scene, this will be the beat that we will show.

Attitudes:
* Appetite for leadership
* Appetite for collaboration
* Patience for problem-solving
* Patience with detail
* Comfort with risk
* Level of drive

Books https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1269827402856665088
On books, the non-fiction kind:
1.
2. Almost nothing in the world can match the ROI of a great book.
3. There is no such thing as a cheap book.
4. Don’t turn book reading into a status game.
5. Books don’t come with a user manual for a reason. You can use them however you like. There are no rules that 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 be followed.
6. Books need not be finished. Develop the skill of not finishing okay books and bad books.
7. A secret for super-learning: Buy many books, start most of them, but finish just a small fraction of them.
8. Books need not be read sequentially.
9. Most people 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥  books. But books have two purposes: they are meant to be 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥 AND they are meant to be 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘥.
10. A good book should be 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘥  once, but 𝘶𝘴𝘦𝘥  multiple times.
11. When reading a book the first time, you’re doing two distinct jobs: learning from it 𝘢𝘯𝘥  making it more user-friendly for the future-you.
12. Shed the habit of keeping books in pristine condition. Best way to appreciate a good book is to make it look thoroughly tainted by the time you’re done reading it. With underlines, sidenotes, and dogears.
13.
14. You can use a good book (that you’ve already read) in multiple ways:
    Got 5 minutes? Skim through underlines on all the pages you’ve dogeared (the best stuff)
    15 min? Skim through all underlines
    60 min? Carefully read all the underlines & remind yourself why they resonated
15. The types of books you choose to read reveal your true priorities better than your stated priorities.
16. Book consumption is less about time availability & more about the physical setting.
    In some settings, it's impossible to read a book e.g., driving, walking. Might as well listen in such settings.

Good policy: listen to a lot of books, buy & read the best ones (multiple times).

Great post! A hack I find useful is trying to recall main concepts from previous chapters  before I continue reading/listening. Exposes gaps in understanding and helps to retain info.

### Social structure
In the Netherlands in the 17th century, social status was largely determined by income. The landed nobility had relatively little importance, since they mostly lived in the more underdeveloped inland provinces, and it was the urban merchant class that dominated Dutch society. The clergy did not have much worldly influence either: the Catholic Church had been more or less suppressed since the onset of the Eighty Years' War with Spain. The new Protestant movement was divided, although exercising social control in many areas to an even greater extent than under the Catholic Church.[11]

That is not to say that aristocrats were without social status. On the contrary, wealthy merchants bought themselves into the nobility by becoming landowners and acquiring a coat of arms and a seal. Aristocrats also mixed with other classes for financial reasons: they married their daughters to wealthy merchants, became traders themselves or took up public or military office. Merchants also started to value public office as a means to greater economic power and prestige. Universities became career pathways to public office. Rich merchants and aristocrats sent their sons on a so-called Grand Tour through Europe. Often accompanied by a private tutor, preferably a scientist himself, these young people visited universities in several European countries. This intermixing of patricians and aristocrats was most prominent in the second half of the century.[12]

After aristocrats and patricians came the affluent middle class, consisting of Protestant ministers, lawyers, physicians, small merchants, industrialists and clerks of large state institutions. Lower status was attributed to farmers, craft and tradesmen, shopkeepers, and government bureaucrats. Below that stood skilled laborers, maids, servants, sailors, and other persons employed in the service industry. At the bottom of the pyramid were "paupers": impoverished peasants, many of whom tried their luck in a city as a beggar or day laborer.

Workers and laborers were generally paid better than in most of Europe, and enjoyed relatively high living standards, although they also paid higher than normal taxes. Farmers prospered from mainly cash crops needed to support the urban and seafaring population.

But there also exists a less visible but nonetheless effective form of censorship when books are reserved for the elite; the book was not originally a medium for expressive liberty. It may serve to confirm the values of a political system, as during the reign of the emperor Augustus, who skillfully surrounded himself with great authors. This is a good ancient example of the control of the media by a political power. However, private and public censorship have continued into the modern era, albeit in various forms.

https://www.famillechretienne.fr/6603/article/manipulateurs-pervers-narcissiques-comment-les-reconnaitre
* certitude d'être exceptionnel
* indifférence à la souffrance d'autrui
  Tous les marqueurs montrent que, depuis plus de cinquante ans, les individus sont en Occident toujours plus narcissiques : l’auto-évaluation permanente, l’individualisme, l’image surdopée de soi, l’incivilité, le culte de l’apparence… Dès lors, la pathologie narcissique devient un marqueur de notre société. L’éducation actuelle la favorise : si vous voulez que votre enfant devienne un tyran, faites-en un prince, dites-lui constamment qu’il est le meilleur, qu’il doit d’abord penser à lui, à son plaisir et à sa réussite. Pablo Picasso fut une PN destructrice et probablement aussi un pervers. Or, le petit Pablito fut non seulement adoré par sa mère, mais fétichisé. En revanche, il ne semble pas qu’une PN puisse apparaître dans une constellation familiale saine.
  les PN victimaires, et les sauveteurs. Les narcissiques victimaires (à distinguer des victimes authentiques) prolifèrent dans les groupes chrétiens parce que ceux-ci sont généralement chaleureux et ouverts à la compassion. L’entourage du victimaire est alors intégralement mobilisé à son service, culpabilisé de ne pas en faire assez, sans être jamais remercié et sans que le victimaire fasse le moindre effort pour se sortir de sa situation.
  Et le profil du sauveteur ?

Là encore, distinguons le sauveur du sauveteur. André Frossard disait que l’intégriste est celui qui fait la volonté de Dieu que Dieu le veuille ou non. Eh bien, le sauveteur est celui qui fait le bien de l’autre… que l’autre le veuille ou non ! C’est la personne qui impose son aide – « C’est pour ton bien » ! Jésus, Lui, propose, Il ne s’impose pas : « Que veux-tu que je fasse pour toi ? »

Cinq conseils pour discerner
1. Si une personne ne reconnaît jamais ses torts, en reconnaît quelques-uns mais ne change pas, voire vous le fait payer, attention ! Peut-être avez-vous affaire à une PN.
2. Jamais Dieu ne peut demander quelque chose qui s’oppose à la loi morale. Celui qui transgresse n’est assurément pas inspiré par Dieu.
3. Plus l’identité d’une communauté est forte, plus il est nécessaire de distinguer les « fonctions » : modérateur, accompagnateur spirituel, médecin Toujours bien séparer for interne et for externe.
4. Toute personne qui exerce une fonction de gouvernement doit connaître les signes principaux de la PN. En cas de doute, elle doit s’informer auprès d’une personne compétente.
5. Repérer les PN ne suffit pas, il faut aussi et d’abord prendre soin des nombreuses victimes dans l’entourage.

Understanding the 12 Stages of Burnout
Psychologists Herbert Freudenberger and Gail North developed the 12-stage model of burnout that affects so many professionals today:
* The Compulsion to Prove Oneself: feeling like you constantly have to demonstrate your worth
* Working Harder:becoming a work “addict”
* Neglecting Needs: not sleeping or eating well, lack of social interaction
* Displacement of Conflicts: blaming others or your situation for all of your problems, including your stress level
* Revision of Values: your friends and family are no longer as important as your work
* Denial of Emerging Problems: intolerance; perceiving others at work as stupid, lazy, demanding, or undisciplined
* Withdrawal: avoiding or dreading social interaction, using alcohol or drugs to try to feel relief from stress
* Odd Behavioral Changes: changes in behavior such as impatience, aggression, and snapping at friends and family
* Depersonalization: feeling detached – seeing neither yourself nor others as valuable
* Inner Emptiness: feeling empty inside and to overcome this, looking for activity such as overeating, sex, alcohol, or drugs
* Depression: feeling lost and unsure, exhausted, future feels bleak and dark
* Burnout Syndrome: can include total mental and physical collapse; time for full medical attention.
