## License

* WARNING: If present, an individual package's license overrides the root one!
* WARNING: the code is free but not the *marketing efforts*, i.e. you are free to copy but must reasonably change the name if competing
* by default: [`UNLICENSE`](https://unlicense.org/) so far.

The general principle is that I want to give back,
and I don't mind people reusing my code and creating jobs / value from it even without crediting me.

However, I'd like the (small) marketing efforts I made to benefit only me,
for ex. the name of the modules or the apps may not be re-usable.
Also I don't want my name to be used as an endorsement.

That's why I'm looking into [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) but not decided yet.

I'm not an expert in licenses, so my work is **implicitly dual-licensed** as fully private for my own use.
This is to allow me to change the license in the future if deemed needed.
```
                  UNLICENSE branch, may stop being updated at some point
                  /
private version ------------------ (forever living private branch)
                      \
                      maybe one day: other license branch (maybe CC0)
```
