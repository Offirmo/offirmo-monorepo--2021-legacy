The npm RPG âš”ðŸ›¡ðŸ’°
===========

https://www.npmjs.com/package/the-npm-rpg

This is a simple command-line RPG. Every time you play, something happens!

**NOTE: still in Beta, savegame may be reset anytime**


## TLDR; I want to play !

(need node > 8) Just:
```bash
> npx  the-npm-rpg
```

### Full install
If you want to play faster:
```bash
> npm install --global  the-npm-rpg
> the-npm-rpg
```


## More info
Inspiration for the game itself was taken from the defunct "boring RPG" https://www.reddit.com/r/boringrpg/.

Inspiration to turn it into a command-line RPG was taken from the "npx" utility, recently integrated to npm. https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b

### I can't get the latest version!
