### I. one-sentence summary

There are usually 4 common goals for a film’s story. Will your story be about:
- Winning?
- Escaping?
- Stopping something or someone?
- Retrieving something of value?

A good story always contains conflicts, of which it can be broken down into:
- External: escalating challenges in the short-term as the world changes - or tactics.
- Internal: decisions with significant impacts on long-term success - or strategy.

### II. one paragraph summary
> The first sentence sets up the story.
> The second, third and fourth sentences cover each of the three turning points.
> The final sentence is the conclusion.

We were taught the 3 act structure mirroring the Hero’s Journey popularised by Joseph Campbell in his 1949 work The Hero with a Thousand Faces, where the:
- 1st Act sets context of the status quo, with an inciting incident that causes the world to change and a call to adventure for the hero.
- 2nd Act has escalating challenges in the main plot that the hero faces, and the introduction of a secondary plot (e.g. a love story strengthening the main plot) coming full circle in the 3rd Act.
- 3rd Act results in a resolution, climax or twist that the hero experiences to the point of no return, which results in a new status quo in the world.

### III. Main character
> A one-sentence summary of the character’s storyline.
> The character’s motivation (what does he/she want abstractly?).
> The character’s goal (what does he/she want concretely?).
> The character’s conflict (what prevents him/her from reaching this goal?).
> The character’s epiphany (what will he/she learn, how will he/she change?
> A one-paragraph summary of the character’s storyline.
> Pixar tip: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.
> Pixar tip: What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?
### IV. multi-paragraph summary
> Go back to the summary you wrote in II and expand each sentence into a paragraph.
> Advice: All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the book ends
### V. Write a one-page description for each major character
> Tip: tells the story from their point of view
> Pixar tip: Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience.
### VI. Expand your one-page plot synopsis into a four-page plot synopsis
> This is the time to address any major plot issues and get the whole story flowing.
### VII. Expand your character descriptions from V into full ‘character charts’.
> an outline of the character and their lives. You can't have too much detail
> Birthdate
> Physical description
> History
> Motivations
> Life goals
### VIII. Using the expanded synopsis, make a list of every scene you will need
> just need to give each scene a one-line description. For example, 'Mad scientist tests time machine'.
> A scene will normally occur in one location and will see the characters changing or learning something new.
> A novel will typically contain between 50 and 100 scenes.
> Pixar tip: If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations.
### IX. Using the scene list, write a multi-paragraph narrative description of each scene
### X. Write your first draft.

### Play type
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types

- ♦ Achievers
  - prefer to gain "points", levels, equipment and other concrete measurements of succeeding in a game
  - will go to great lengths to achieve rewards that are merely cosmetic
  - want opportunity to show off their skill and hold elite status to others
- ♠ Explorers
  - prefer discovering areas, and immerse themselves in the game world
  - often annoyed by time-restricted missions as that does not allow them to traverse at their own pace
  - enjoy finding glitches or a hidden easter egg
  - enrich themselves in any back story or lore they can find about the people and places in-game
- ♥ Socializers
  - play games for the social aspect, rather than the actual game itself
  - gain the most enjoyment from a game by interacting with other players, and sometimes, computer-controlled characters with personality = offer significant relationships
  - The game is merely a tool they use to meet others in-game or outside of it
  - play some of the more popular games so that they can use the multi-player features
  - some single-player games have a strong community around them. Examples of single-player games where players use the forums to post pictures of what they've created and share experiences
- ♣ Killers
  - thrive on competition with other players, and prefer fighting them to scripted computer-controlled opponents
  - joy of pitting one's skills against an actual player-controlled opponent
  - for most, the joy results from a friendly competitive spirit
  - for others, it's more about power and the ability to hurt others or the thrill of the hunt



Dan Harmon (creator of Rick and Morty and Community) has since simplified the theory into 8 steps:
- Establish a protagonist (You) - A character is in a zone of comfort.
- Something ain’t quite right (Need) - We learn that things aren’t perfect in our hero’s universe, setting the stage for external conflict.
- Crossing the Threshold (Go) - They enter an unfamiliar situation, and begin their journey.
- The Road of Trials (Search) - They adapt to their unfamiliar situation. They gain the skills they’ll need to achieve their goals and return home.
- Meeting with the Goddess (Find) - They get what they wanted. The Need (number 2) is fulfilled.
- Pay the Price (Take) - They pay a price for achieving their goal, but a secondary goal is achieved.
- Bringing it Home (Return) - They cross the return threshold, and come back to where they started.
- Master of both Worlds (Change) - The protagonist is in control of their situation, having changed.


Beats
We analysed the script and were asked to identify the parts where we thought were important.
This is usually something where there is a change from the status quo - it could be a new character introduced, the meeting of hearts, a power dynamic change between characters or a climax/twist.
We call this a beat. A short film like this (~10 minutes) will probably have a maximum of 5-6 beats, so we started with around 10+ beats and culled it to 6 core ones.
Of all the different beats, there will be the heart of the film in one of the beats. If we had to only show one scene, this will be the beat that we will show.
