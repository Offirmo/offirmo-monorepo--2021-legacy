- Latest stable ES, with latest exports
- as a convenience, pre-build CJS for latest ES (https://node.green/) supported by the oldest active LTS node (https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
- sometimes a few stage 4 when they are already supported https://github.com/tc39/ecma262
- TODO are refreshes major or minor?? Most likely major (see @sindre)

## next
- node 12 ?
- ES2020 ?
- new typescript ?


## 2019-07-27
