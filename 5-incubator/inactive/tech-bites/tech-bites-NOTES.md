P5 should be leading your team’s execution on engineering
P6 should be driving action in your teams, after identifying opportunities themselves

extensible
 The service worker was designed as part of the extensible web. The idea is that we, as browser developers, acknowledge that we are not better at web development than web developers. And as such, we shouldn't provide narrow high-level APIs that solve a particular problem using patterns we like, and instead give you access to the guts of the browser and let you do it how you want, in a way that works best for your users.

"The most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist."
It’s all about simplicity.
