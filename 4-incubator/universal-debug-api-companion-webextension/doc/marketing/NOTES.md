Offirmo’s Universal Web Dev Tool

## Summary
Get convenient dev features for your JavaScript code with no downsides

## Detailed Description
This is for web developers writing complex/semi-complex JavaScript.

Remember the last time you had no clue about what your code was doing?

Wishing you could just turn logs on on a prod version?

This extension is a companion to Offirmo’s Universal Debug API, which provides your webapp with:
- loggers with controllable log level
- local overrides of variables
- debug commands (in beta)
- exposition of internal data (in beta)

Along with a UI to conveniently control those features.

You'll have to modify your source code to include and use "Offirmo’s Universal Debug API" (https://github.com/Offirmo/offirmo-monorepo/wiki/Offirmo%E2%80%99s-Universal-Debug-Api)
but this comes at no cost since you only have to bundle/use a very small No-Op version, doing nothing at all.

However, when this extension is used and active,
the No-Op version will be dynamically replaced by an active version,
served by the extension. The replacement is done synchronously before any other code can execute,
so it just works without any complex setup.
