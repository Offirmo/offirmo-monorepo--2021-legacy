The npm RPG âš”ðŸ›¡ðŸ’°
===========

https://www.npmjs.com/package/the-npm-rpg


This is a simple command-line RPG. Every time you launch the command, something happens!

**NOTE: very early stage of development**


## TLDR; I want to play !

(need node > 8) Just:
```bash
> npx  the-npm-rpg
```

### Full install
If you want to play faster:
```bash
> npm install --global  the-npm-rpg
> the-npm-rpg
```


## More info
Inspiration for the game itself was taken from the defunct "boring RPG" https://www.reddit.com/r/boringrpg/.

Inspiration to turn it into a command-line RPG was taken from the "npx" utility, recently integrated to npm. https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b

## Troubleshooting
Please file a GitHub bug.

### I can't get the latest version!
npx has a cache. To force a refresh:
`npx the-npm-rpg --ignore-existing`

### I can't equip weapons/armors
In progress!!!
