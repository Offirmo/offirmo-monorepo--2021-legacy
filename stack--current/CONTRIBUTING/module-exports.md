# Export and transpilation policy

## Policy

The public modules in this mono-repo ase exposed as:
- Latest stable ES, with latest stable module exports
  - with sometimes a few stage 4 features when they are already widely supported https://github.com/tc39/ecma262
- as a convenience, pre-built CJS for latest ES (https://node.green/)
  supported by the oldest active LTS node (https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/ or https://github.com/nodejs/Release)
- for modules in Typescript, trying to use the latest Typescript, best effort.
- while webpack is not used in this repo(*), we acknowledge that it's widely used and thus aim to support its latest version
  - unfortunately we have an old webpack for netlify-lambda

See below more exact numbers.

Note: I do NOT agree with the opinion "don't transpile node_modules", see [issue]()

## Maintainer playbook
* when updating this file, also update `0-scripts/build-typescript.js`
* when updating node/lib, also update
  * `.nvmrc`
  * `engines` from root `package.json` = `"node":`
  * `"@types/node"`
  * `tsconfig.json`: `"lib":`
  * replace in `package.json`: `src.es202x`
  * `B-apps--support/online-adventur.es/heroku/.babelrc`
  * `B-apps--support/online-adventur.es/functions/.babelrc`
  * Netlify:
    * ensure AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME = "nodejsXX.x" is valid in `netlify.toml`
    * in admin change AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME = nodeXX.x or sth
  * sibling repos
    * adjust `.nvmrc` and `netlify.toml` in online-adventures.github.io




## TODO
- TODO are refreshes major or minor?? Most likely major (see @sindre)
