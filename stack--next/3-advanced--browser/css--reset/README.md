## CSS reset

Nothing to see here, one day I plan to make my own CSS reset.

In the meantime, it's just normalize.css + notes


## Introduction

### What is a CSS RESET?

From Eric Meyer https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
> The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
> (...) Reset styles quite often appear in CSS frameworks...
>
> The reset styles (...) are intentionally very generic. There isn't any default color or background set for the body element, for example. (...)
>
> Goal: After including the appropriate stylesheet from this module,
> HTML pages using non-deprecated elements should look identical on every browser and form factor
