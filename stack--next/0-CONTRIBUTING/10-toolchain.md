## package manager
**yarn**

Why yarn over npm?
* last try 2022/03 npm 8
* (blocker) npm output spurious "timing" lines blotting the output
* npm requires "run" npm run dev


## monorepo
* **yarn workspaces**
* complemented by https://github.com/Thinkmill/manypkg

Why not bolt? https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt
* maintained but sort of dead

Why not rush? https://rushjs.io/
* too complicated, needs every pkg declared in a huge config
