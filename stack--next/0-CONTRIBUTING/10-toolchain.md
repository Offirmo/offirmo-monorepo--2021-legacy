## package manager
**yarn**

Why yarn over npm?
* last try 2022/03 npm 8
* (blocker) npm output spurious "timing" lines blotting the output
* npm requires "run" npm run dev


## monorepo
* **yarn workspaces**
* complemented by https://github.com/Thinkmill/manypkg

Why not bolt? https://github.com/boltpkg/bolt
* maintained but sort of dead

Why not rush? https://rushjs.io/
* has benefits https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~790620688/blog/2021/03/30/1071416904/A+ShipIt+review+of+Rush+a+scalable+monorepo+manager+for+the+web
* too complicated, needs every pkg declared in a huge config
