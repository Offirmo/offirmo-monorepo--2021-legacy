  * "In filmmaking and television production, presence, also known as room tone, is the “silence” recorded at a location or space when no dialog is spoken. Presence is similar to ambience, but is distinguished by a lack of explicit background noise."
  * "the noise print loop should not have any features that can be perceived as being something specific"

  * Combine them with the reverberation
  * Use a scripted mechanic to cross-fade between them when the player is changing between distinctive locations. You can get the distance between the 2 location clear limits and the position of the player character in your game, and transform those numbers to a percentage of how much to lower the volume of each noise print’s loop, according to the position of the player’s character. That way you provide smooth transitions between the locations the player character is moving. Be careful, if the noise prints are very similar, during same volume levels flanging may appear. To avoid it, test your level’s transitions in a good listening environment or with a set of headphones.
  * Use specified loudness levels
  * Classify, organize and rule them all
    * Open, closed and special spaces.
    * Kind of environment, urban, industrial, natural, unnatural.
    * Day or night.
    * Friendly and hostile environments.
    * Game states.
    * Story-line position
