> A task is any JavaScript code which is scheduled to be run by the standard mechanisms
> such as initially starting to run a program, an event callback being run, or an interval or timeout being fired.
>These all get scheduled on the task queue.

> each time a task exits, the event loop checks to see if the task is returning control to other JavaScript code.
> If not, it runs all of the microtasks in the microtask queue.
> The microtask queue is, then, processed multiple times per iteration of the event loop, including after handling events and other callbacks.
> If a microtask adds more microtasks to the queue by calling queueMicrotask(),
> those newly-added microtasks execute before the next task is run.
> That's because the event loop will keep calling microtasks until there are none left in the queue, even if more keep getting added.

Note that Chrome timeouts are capped at >=1ms
